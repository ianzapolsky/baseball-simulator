BaseballSim
===========

BaseballSim is a small yet accurate statistical baseball simulator written in Java.

Using historical baseball statistics mined from www.baseball-reference.com, BaseballSim constructs
two teams specified by the user and then pits them against one another in a Bill James-inspired 
simulation.

BaseballSim takes into consideration:
* All available batting, pitching, and fielding information of players
* Handedness of pitcher/batter matchup (LH vs. RH, RH vs. RH, etc.)
* Errors, double plays, sacrifice flies
* Pitcher fatigue based on pitch count
* Accurate baserunning models
* Simulated intelligent bullpen management
